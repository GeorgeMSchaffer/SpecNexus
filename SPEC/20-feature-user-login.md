# Feature: User Login

## Outcome
Users can securely access SargentNexus using organization-scoped credentials.

## Scope
- In: credential validation, protected session/token issue, first-login password change for seeded Site Admin
- Out: MFA, social login providers, remember this device

## Login Context
- User email is globally unique across the system.
- User password are secured through hashing.

## Scenarios (Given/When/Then)
1. Given a valid active user account
   When they submit correct email and password
   Then the API authenticates the user and returns the authenticated session or token response

2. Given an invalid email or password
   When a login attempt is submitted
   Then the API returns an authentication failure response without exposing which credential was incorrect

3. Given 5 failed login attempts for the same account within 15 minutes
   When another login attempt is made before the lockout expires
   Then the API denies authentication for 15 minutes

4. Given the seeded Site Admin account is logging in for the first time
   When authentication succeeds
   Then the user is required to change their password before accessing protected application features

5. Given an unauthenticated request to a protected feature
   When the request is made without valid authentication
   Then access is denied

## Edge Cases
- Case-insensitive email match if email lookup is normalized that way by the chosen contract
- Inactive users
- Case-insensitive email match

## Contracts Impacted
- `POST /api/v1/auth/login`
- `POST /api/v1/auth/change-password`

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All scenarios above implemented
- [ ] Valid credentials allow login
- [ ] Invalid credentials are rejected
- [ ] Five failed login attempts within 15 minutes cause a 15-minute lockout
- [ ] Inactive users are denied authentication
- [ ] Seed Site Admin must change password on first login
- [ ] Protected features reject unauthenticated access
