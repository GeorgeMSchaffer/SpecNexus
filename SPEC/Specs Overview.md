# SargentNexus MVP Single Source Specification

## Document Metadata
- Status: Draft
- Last Updated: 2026-07-30
- Audience: Engineering, Product, QA, AI coding agents
- Purpose: Provide one implementation-ready spec that reduces duplication while preserving canonical rules from `SPEC/*.md`.

## Product Intent
SargentNexus is a tenant-scoped collaboration platform for capturing, refining, and advancing process ideas.
The MVP emphasizes strict role boundaries, predictable lifecycle behavior, and contract-first API implementation.

The system supports organization administration, board workflow configuration, and idea collaboration through tags, mentions, comments, and upvotes.
Security-sensitive flows include password policy enforcement, lockout handling, forced first-login password change, and audited administration actions.

## Source of Truth and Usage
- Canonical behavior remains in `SPEC/*.md`.
- This file is the preferred AI ingestion entrypoint for implementation work.
- If behavior changes, update the relevant canonical specs and keep this overview aligned.

## MVP Scope
### In Scope
- Authentication and first-login password change
- Organization and user administration
- Boards and statuses with swimlane ordering
- Idea CRUD and status movement
- Tags, mentions, comments, and upvotes
- Audit event generation
- Notification event persistence for internal verification

### Deferred Scope
- OAuth and SSO
- Reporting
- Guaranteed outbound email delivery
- Remember-this-device behavior
- Public event query endpoints

## Roles and Permission Summary
| Role | Core Responsibility | Notable Limits |
|---|---|---|
| Site Admin | Global platform administration across organizations | Not tenant-owned |
| Org Admin | Administration within own organization | Cannot administer outside own org |
| User | Creates/edits ideas and collaborates | No organization administration |
| Read Only | Collaboration via comments and upvotes | Cannot edit idea content or board configuration |

Key rule: all tenant-owned data is organization-scoped; Site Admin is global and not organization-owned.

## Global Invariants and Data Rules
- Emails are globally unique.
- Non-Site Admin users have exactly one organization and one role.
- Organization and user text fields are trimmed before validation and persistence.
- Status deletion is soft-delete only; historical/detail references remain readable.
- Non-2xx API responses use a problem-details-style envelope.
- Update behavior is last-write-wins unless a narrower contract states otherwise.
- Identifiers are GUID strings and timestamps are UTC ISO-8601 strings.
- Pagination shape is `items`, `page`, `pageSize`, `totalCount`, `sortBy`, `sortDirection`.

## Feature Behavior
### Authentication and Access
- Login uses email and password.
- Inactive users are denied authentication.
- Lockout: 5 failed attempts in 15 minutes trigger a 15-minute lockout window.
- Seeded Site Admin must change password on first successful login.
- Development-only seed creates exactly 3 demo organizations.
- Each demo organization includes Org Admin, User, and Read Only users initialized with `abc123!` without a forced password change.
- Admin-issued temporary password reset is one-time display, expires in 24 hours, and forces password change on first use.
- Post-MVP self-service reset uses a private single-use email link that expires after 24 hours, returns generic request and invalid-link responses, and revokes all sessions after success.

### Organizations and Users
- Only Site Admin can create organizations.
- Site Admin and Org Admin can edit organizations in authorized scope.
- Organizations are archived, never hard-deleted.
- New organizations auto-provision default statuses and one default board.
- Last Org Admin self-demotion/deactivation is blocked.
- User states are limited to `Active` and `Inactive` in MVP.

### Boards and Statuses
- Statuses are organization-scoped.
- Default statuses are provisioned on organization creation.
- Boards require at least 2 swimlanes.
- Swimlane reorder persists immediately after drag-and-drop completion.
- Boards can select subsets of organization statuses.

### Ideas and Engagement
- Required fields: title, description, priority.
- Limits: title 150, description 4000, comment body 2000, tag name 100.
- Default status is the left-most swimlane when omitted at create time.
- Board cards remain compact: title, priority, assignee display, upvote state.
- Clicking card title opens in-context detail overlay for full edit workflow.
- Ideas in `Complete` remain editable and collaborative.
- Mentions resolve by same-organization email only.
- Unresolved mentions show inline validation and block save.
- Upvote is a toggle with max one active upvote per user per idea.

### Notifications and Audit
- Notification events are generated for idea mention, comment mention, comment-on-idea, and status change.
- Notification events are persisted for internal verification in MVP.
- Guaranteed outbound email delivery remains deferred.
- Audit events are required for auth, admin, and idea lifecycle actions.

## Validation and Error Semantics
- API boundary validates shape, required fields, and basic field constraints.
- Application and Domain enforce business rules, authorization rules, and invariants.
- Problem-details envelope is mandatory for all non-2xx responses.
- Sensitive flows define success, failure, expiry, and recovery behavior explicitly.

## Architecture Boundaries
- API: HTTP mapping, authentication middleware, validation, response contracts
- Application: use-case orchestration, tenant scoping, authorization enforcement
- Domain: entity invariants and lifecycle rules
- Infrastructure: persistence, hashing, seeding, audit/notification event storage
- Client: role-aware UX and clear validation feedback without owning business rules

## Test and Verification Mapping
### Unit
- Authentication rules and lockout behavior
- Site Admin and Development seed rules, including idempotency
- User CSV parsing, validation, duplicate detection, and atomic rejection behavior
- Board validation rules
- Tag normalization and concurrency merge behavior
- Mention resolution behavior
- Upvote toggle and ownership behavior

### Integration
- Auth success/failure/lockout branches
- Protected endpoints rejecting unauthenticated calls
- Site Admin forced password change on first login
- Development demo seed graph and user setup
- Tenant-scoped organization and user CRUD
- User CSV template download and authorized atomic import success/failure paths
- Board minimum-swimlane enforcement
- Idea comment and upvote role behavior

### Contract
- Response and request semantics aligned with `SPEC/30-Contracts.md`
- Problem-details envelope on all non-2xx responses
- Authentication, organization, user, board, status, idea contract alignment with `SPEC/30-Contracts.md`

### Startup Safety
- Demo seed runs only in Development
- Non-Development startup suppresses demo seed

## Delivery Constraints and Non-Goals
- No hardcoded secrets.
- No new package additions without explicit approval.
- Deferred scope must not leak into MVP implementation.
- Spec changes must be reflected in contract and verification artifacts.

## Resolved Decisions (2026-07-30)
- Validation message conventions are standardized in `SPEC/30-Contracts.md` and must be mirrored by UI text where practical.
- Reporting baseline requirements and export formats are defined in `SPEC/20-feature-reporting.md` as post-MVP scope.
- OAuth account-link and claim-mapping edge-case decisions are defined in `SPEC/20-feature-oauth.md`.
- Rich-content and attachment direction is defined in `SPEC/20-feature-ideas-and-engagement.md` as out of MVP and out of initial OAuth phase scope.

Open questions remaining for MVP: none.

### Clarification Rule
If behavior is ambiguous or conflicting, ask for clarification before implementation.

### Change Control Rule
Update canonical `SPEC/*.md` first, then align this overview, implementation, and tests.
