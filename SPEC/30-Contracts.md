# Contracts

## Purpose
Defines the system contracts that implementations must follow.

## Contract Authorship Rule
- Canonical contract behavior is authored in this file and related canonical `SPEC/20-feature-*.md` docs.
- Contract tests verify the API surface directly against the canonical documents under `SPEC`.
- Do not introduce API behavior without corresponding canonical updates in `SPEC`.

## Route Conventions
- HTTP APIs use path versioning under `/api/v1`.
- Resource routes use plural nouns.
- Nested routes are allowed when needed to express parent-child ownership clearly.

## MVP Boundary For External Auth
- MVP contract conformance does not require OAuth or SAML endpoints.
- OAuth/OIDC endpoints are planned for post-MVP Phase 2.
- SAML endpoints are planned for a post-OAuth phase.
- Until those phases begin, `/api/v1/auth/*` contracts are limited to local credential and password-management flows defined in this document.

## Error Envelope
- All non-2xx responses use a problem-details-style payload.
- Standard fields are `type`, `title`, `status`, `detail`, and `instance`.
- Validation failures may include an additional `errors` object keyed by field name.

## Standard Error Responses
- `400 Bad Request`: request JSON is malformed, required fields are missing, field values violate contract constraints, or the request shape is otherwise invalid.
- `401 Unauthorized`: the caller is not authenticated or the authentication token is missing, expired, or invalid.
- `403 Forbidden`: the caller is authenticated but not permitted to perform the requested action in the current scope.
- `404 Not Found`: the targeted resource does not exist or is not visible within the caller's authorized scope.

## Collection Conventions
- Organization, user, idea, and comment list endpoints support pagination in MVP.
- Smaller configuration collections such as statuses, boards, and tags may return full result sets unless a feature-specific contract says otherwise.
- Paginated collections support basic filtering plus one explicit sort field and sort direction.
- Archived organizations are hidden from list results by default unless explicitly filtered with `isArchived=true` or an equivalent include-archived flag.

## Update Conventions
- MVP update operations use last-write-wins behavior unless a feature-specific contract defines a stronger rule.

## Validation Ownership
- The API contract validates request shape, required fields, and basic field constraints.
- The Application and Domain layers enforce business rules, authorization rules, and cross-entity invariants.

## Validation Message Conventions
- API validation messages follow these canonical templates:
	- Required: `<FieldName> is required.`
	- Max length: `<FieldName> must be <N> characters or fewer.`
	- Min length: `<FieldName> must be at least <N> characters.`
	- Invalid format: `<FieldName> must be a valid <FormatName>.`
	- Invalid enum value: `<FieldName> must be one of: <Value1>, <Value2>, <Value3>.`
	- Numeric or date range: `<FieldName> must be between <Min> and <Max>.`
	- Mention resolution: `Mention '<Value>' could not be resolved to a user in your organization.`
- Validation failures use the `errors` object keyed by request field names.
- UI should mirror API validation wording where practical to reduce interpretation drift.

## Shared Data Rules
- Identifiers are GUID strings.
- Timestamps are UTC ISO-8601 strings.
- Enum values are serialized as strings.
- Paginated responses use:
	- `items`
	- `page`
	- `pageSize`
	- `totalCount`
	- `sortBy`
	- `sortDirection`
- User and organization text fields are trimmed before validation and persistence.
- First and last name maximum length is 100 characters.
- Company name maximum length is 200 characters.
- Address maximum length is 200 characters.
- City maximum length is 100 characters.
- State maximum length is 50 characters.
- Zip maximum length is 20 characters.
- Phone maximum length is 25 characters.
- Comment body maximum length is 2000 characters and supports plain text with line breaks only.

## Authentication Contracts

	- `email` string
	- `status` string

Error responses:
- `401` invalid credentials
- `403` inactive account
- `429` locked out after 5 failed attempts within 15 minutes

### `GET /api/v1/auth/me`
Purpose: Return the currently authenticated user summary.

Success response `200`:
- `userId`
- `organizationId`
- `role`
- `firstName`
- `lastName`
- `email`
- `status`

Error responses:
- `401` caller is not authenticated

### `PUT /api/v1/auth/me`
Purpose: Update the currently authenticated user's editable profile fields.

Request body:
- `firstName` required string, max 100 characters
- `lastName` required string, max 100 characters

Both fields are trimmed before persistence. Email, role, organization, and status cannot be changed through this endpoint.

Success response `200`:
- updated authenticated user summary using the same shape as `GET /api/v1/auth/me`

Error responses:
- `400` missing or invalid name fields
- `401` caller is not authenticated or the authenticated user cannot be resolved

### `POST /api/v1/auth/change-password`
Purpose: Change the current user's password, including the first-login Site Admin password change.

Request body:
- `currentPassword` required string
- `newPassword` required string

Success response:
- `204 No Content`

Error responses:
- `400` invalid password policy
- `401` invalid current password
- `403` caller is authenticated but not allowed to change the password in the current state

### `POST /api/v1/users/{userId}/temporary-password`
Purpose: MVP/P1 admin-issued temporary password reset.

Request body:
- empty body or implementation-defined admin note

Success response `200`:
- `temporaryPassword` string

Error responses:
- `401` caller is not authenticated
- `403` caller is authenticated but not allowed to issue a temporary password for the target user
- `404` target user does not exist or is outside caller scope

Behavior rules:
- the temporary password is displayed one time only
- the temporary password expires after 24 hours if unused
- the user must change the password on first successful use

### `POST /api/v1/auth/password-reset/request`
Purpose: Post-MVP anonymous request for a self-service password-reset email.

Request body:
- `email` required string, valid email format

Success response `202 Accepted`:
- `message` string with the same generic wording for every syntactically valid request

Behavior rules:
- only active accounts with local-password credentials are eligible, including Site Admin and organization users
- unknown, inactive, external-only, throttled, and eligible emails receive the same response
- eligible requests send an unlinked anonymous reset-page URL containing a cryptographically random bearer token
- issuing a new token invalidates every prior token for the account
- the token expires after 24 hours and is single-use
- delivery is limited to 3 requests per normalized email and 10 requests per source IP in a rolling 15-minute window
- requests above either limit return the generic success response without sending an email
- token values are not persisted in plaintext or included in logs, audit metadata, analytics, or responses

Error responses:
- `400` malformed request body, missing email, or invalid email format

### `POST /api/v1/auth/password-reset/confirm`
Purpose: Post-MVP anonymous completion of a self-service password reset using the emailed token.

Request body:
- `token` required string
- `newPassword` required string
- `confirmPassword` required string

Success response:
- `204 No Content`

Behavior rules:
- `newPassword` and `confirmPassword` must match
- the new password must satisfy the existing authentication complexity policy
- invalid, expired, superseded, and used tokens return the same invalid-link failure
- a successful reset consumes the token and revokes all existing sessions for the account
- the response does not authenticate the user; the client shows confirmation and returns to Login
- token and plaintext password values are not persisted or included in logs, audit metadata, analytics, or error responses

Error responses:
- `400` malformed request, password mismatch, password-policy failure, or invalid-link failure
