# Delivery Backlog

## Purpose
Break the technical implementation plan into execution-ready epics and task slices.

## Team Lanes
- API: HTTP contracts, endpoint mapping, OpenAPI, auth middleware, problem-details responses
- Application: use cases, authorization, orchestration, business rules, audit and notification event triggering
- Infrastructure: EF Core mappings, migrations, database constraints, password hashing, token issuance, environment-seeded credentials
- Client: Blazor pages, Fluent UI layouts, workflow composition, role-aware affordances
- QA: contract, integration, end-to-end, and regression validation

## Dependency Rules
- Epics 2 through 7 depend on Epic 1 foundation work.
- Epic 3 depends on authentication primitives from Epic 2 for user and role handling.
- Epic 4 depends on organization bootstrap from Epic 3.
- Epic 5 depends on Epic 4 because ideas require board and status configuration.
- Epic 6 depends on Epic 5 because notification and audit surfaces attach to collaboration workflows.
- Epic 7 can begin after Epics 2 through 5 expose stable API contracts for each feature area.
- Epic 8 depends on executable slices from all previous epics.
- Epic 9 (OAuth, post-MVP Phase 2) depends on MVP release completion and stable auth contracts.
- Epic 10 (SAML, post-OAuth) depends on Epic 9 completion.

Dependencies:
- Epics 1 through 5

## Epic 7: Blazor Client Experience
Outcome: the client supports the agreed workflows and role boundaries with the revised layout and navigation.

Suggested sequencing by team:
- Client: page shells, shared components, layout revisions, Settings flows, board and idea flows, detail views
- API/Application: close support loop for UI-driven gaps discovered during composition
- QA: navigation, validation, role-affordance, and regression checks

Tasks:

**Bug fixes:**
- fix the errant `else {` rendered as visible content on the Change Password screen
- remove all Weather and Counter placeholder pages, routes, nav links, and sample code

**Header and navigation:**
- set header background to `rgb(33, 37, 41)`; render username in white
- move sign-out to an icon button immediately left of the username display
- add gear icon to header that navigates to `/settings`
- replace visible Workflow terminology with Board/Boards; use canonical `/boards` and `/board/{boardId}` routes with compatibility redirects

**Settings area (formerly Admin):**
- rename all Admin routes to `/settings/...`, page titles to "Settings", and gear icon tooltip to "Settings"
- build Settings landing page with My Profile link for all authenticated users and role-scoped admin links:
  - Site Admin: Organizations, Users, Boards & Statuses
  - Org Admin: Users and Boards & Statuses (own org only)
  - Member: no admin links rendered
- implement list-first / form-swap pattern for Organizations, Users, and Boards & Statuses pages:
  - default to list view; Create button visible only to permitted roles (Create Organization: Site Admin only)
  - clicking Edit or Create swaps to form view; saving or cancelling returns to list with list refreshed
- display invite code in organization list and detail; provide regenerate action for admins

**Boards page:**
- restrict the Boards page to a board list only (remove all non-list content)
- clicking a board navigates to that board's swimlane/kanban view

**Board detail (Kanban board):**
- build `/board/{boardId}` as the canonical Kanban swimlane board
- render one column per status on the selected board, ordered by `Status.SortOrder`; horizontal scroll on overflow
- restyle the Board detail hierarchy, full-height lanes, density, cards, tag rows, persona footers, and age placement from `mockups/sprint-management/idea-board.html`; preserve configured statuses and approved controls, excluding demo-only pivots, conversion actions, duplicate commands, and sprint features
- render compact idea cards showing title, priority, Business Impact chip, first three alphabetical tags plus `+N`, first three ordered assignee personas plus `+N`, viewer-local submission age, current-user upvote control/count, and comment control/count
- clicking a card title opens an in-context detail overlay (no page navigation); overlay fields: title, priority, due date, description, zero-to-five assignees, zero-to-10 tags, mentions, comments; overlay actions: Cancel, Save Idea, Move in Board
- add primary **New Idea** button in board header that opens overlay in create mode (hidden for ReadOnly users)
- add filter chips (All / Created by me / Assigned to me) and search input (filters by title, tag, or assignee, client-side); filtering is combinable; empty columns remain visible with "No ideas" placeholder
- implement card drag-and-drop from a dedicated handle: optimistic column move, one status call, revert on failure with error toast
- immediately relocate a card when status changes in Idea Detail without waiting for overlay close
- open and focus comments from the card comment action; implement optimistic upvote state/count with rollback
- add role-aware description editing and confirmed admin-only soft delete
- implement column reorder drag for SiteAdmin and OrgAdmin: optimistic reorder, saves immediately on drop, call `PUT /api/v1/boards/{boardId}/statuses/{statusId}` per changed status, revert all on failure with error toast
- implement components in `src/SargentNexus.Client/Shared/Kanban/`: `IdeaKanbanBoard.razor`, `KanbanColumn.razor`, `IdeaCard.razor`
- add `IdeaAssignee` persistence and migrate every valid singular assignment before dropping the old `AssigneeUserId` relationship
- replace singular assignee contracts with bounded collections; validate distinct active same-organization users, enforce author/admin assignment permission, update notifications/audit/CSV, and make Assigned to me use collection membership
- implement searchable tag selection/creation with organization-scoped normalization and a 10-tag limit
- render persona initials from first and last name followed by first name, with full accessible names and missing-name fallback
- calculate age from viewer-local calendar dates with zero/singular/plural formatting and future clamping through a testable clock boundary

**Primary navigation:**
- remove border radius and the active left border from the selected primary-navigation item; use a flat selected background and stronger text/icon color while preserving `aria-current` and keyboard focus styling
- leave tabs, pivots, filter chips, and segmented controls unchanged

**Idea Fields settings:**
- add `/settings/organizations/{orgId}/idea-fields` for Site Admin and in-scope Org Admin
- manage separate sortable Idea Type and Business Impact lists; Business Impact includes editable chip color
- block deletion of the last active option and show archived options without allowing new assignment

**Uniform list conventions (all list pages):**
- add a uniform search bar above every entity list
- implement server-side pagination with page size options 25 (default), 50, 100, 250
- wire `search`, `page`, and `pageSize` query params to corresponding API endpoints
- changing search text resets to page 1
- organization list columns and search scope: Title, Description, Invite Code, Status

**Role-aware client flows:**
- build login flow for globally unique email credentials
- build first-login password change and inactive-account states
- enforce visible role-based UI affordances for Read Only, User, Org Admin, and Site Admin
- build board, idea detail, comment, tag, mention, and upvote interfaces

Exit criteria:
- all bug fixes from SPEC/20-feature-client-ui-revisions.md verified as resolved
- header, horizontal menu, gear icon, and Settings area match the approved layout spec
- Boards page shows only a board list; clicking opens `/board/{boardId}`
- Board detail is functional: expanded compact cards, title-click overlay, New Idea, search/filter, dedicated-handle drag with rollback, immediate overlay status movement, upvote/comment actions, and admin column reorder
- all list pages have uniform search bar and server-side pagination with correct page sizes
- no Admin-labeled routes, titles, or text remain

Dependencies:
- Epics 2 through 5 primarily, with Epic 6 optional for internal diagnostics only

## Recommended Execution Order
1. Complete Epic 1 fully before parallelizing downstream work.
2. Run Epic 2 next because authentication gates all protected workflows.
3. Run Epic 3 and the schema portion of Epic 4 in close sequence because tenant bootstrap creates default boards and statuses.
4. Finish Epic 4 before starting broad Idea and Engagement implementation in Epic 5.
5. Add Epic 6 once core collaboration events exist so event shapes settle late but before hardening.
6. Run Epic 7 continuously after API slices stabilize, but reserve final UI completion until Epics 2 through 5 are functionally complete.
7. Close with Epic 8 as the release gate.
8. Start Epic 9 only after MVP release criteria are met.
9. Execute Epic 10 after Epic 9 stabilizes.
